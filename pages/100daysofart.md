## Day 4
### A Running Start!
Alright, it's day 4.

The [tutorial](http://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart) for today is a simple run animation.

I'm not fully satisfied with how this turned out, but that's ok, maybe I'll revisit this in the future.

## Day 3
### A Whiff of Smoke!
Day 3, let's do this!

Today I'll do the next [tutorial](http://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart), which is a smoke effect!

It's a puff of smoke, emitting from a wall of some sort.

## Day 2
### Throwing Punches!
Today is the second day of this series, so let’s dive right into it!

This time, I’ll be doing a simple attack. I went with a punch, which is also the primary example in the [tutorial](http://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart).

The base (i.e. first frame) is a modified version of the first frame of the idle animation I did on day 0, now with slight shading to indicate how close to the camera a part is, and the arms brought up into a ready stance.


## Day 1
### Oooh, Shiny!
Today is day 1 of the pixel art challenge, so I'm starting on the first [tutorial](http://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart):

Shines!

So, for my shiny object, I’ll use the Splendid Screen, from Team Fortress 2.
![Day 1 Base]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/projects/days100/Day1SplendidScreen.gif){:class="narrow-img"}

Then, we add a simple shine, just going down the shield.
![Day 1 Simple]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/projects/days100/Day1ShineSimpleYuge.gif){:class="narrow-img"}

Looks pretty nice!

But, to make it even better, we can add an extra flash to it!
![Day 1 Full]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/projects/days100/Day1ShineYuge.gif){:class="narrow-img"}

Perfect!


## Day 0
### Pixel art development challenge: the beginning

Today marks the start of a new art challenge for me. To start off the 100DaysOfArt, I'm going to use a tutorial to kick up my pixel art skills. Every day, I’ll be following a new one of the tutorials from [this page](http://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart).

Today, however, I’ve decided to start it off by drawing a simple idle animation of the character I’ll be using for this project.

So, everyone, say hello to Daniel!

![Day 0 - Daniel]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/projects/days100/DanielIdleYuge.gif){:class="narrow-img"}

It’s just a simple idle animation on a white background for now, but trust me, these’ll be fun.
