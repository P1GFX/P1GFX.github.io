## Day 2
### Throwing Punches!
Today is the second day of this series, so let’s dive right into it!

This time, we’ll be doing a simple attack. I went with a punch, which is also the primary example in the [tutorial](http://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart).

The base (i.e. first frame) Is a modified version of the first frame of the idle animation we did on day 0, now with slight shading to indicate how close to the camera a part is, and the arms brought up into a ready stance.


## Day 1
### Oooh, Shiny
Today is day 1 of the pixel art challenge, so I'm starting on the first tutorial:

Shines!

So, for my shiny object, I’ll use the Splendid Screen, from Team Fortress 2.

## Day 0
### Pixel art development challenge: the beginning

Today marks the start of a new art challenge for me. To start off the 100DaysOfArt, I'm going to use a tutorial to kick up my pixel art skills. Every day, I’ll be following a new one of the tutorials from [this page](http://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart).

Today, however, I’ve decided to start it off by drawing a simple idle animation of the character I’ll be using for this project.

So, everyone, say hello to Daniel!

It’s just a simple idle animation on a white background for now, but trust me, these’ll be fun.
