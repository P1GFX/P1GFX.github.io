This is a touched up version of the endgame map of a Portugal campaign in [Europa Universalis 4](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/europa-universalis-4). To create this map, I took the built-in map screenshot, then selected only the regions owned by myself or my subsidiaries.

Then these regions were copied into a new layer, and the original layer was flattened to just land and water. The owned regions were then given a darker border. I then added the flags from [this imgur gallery](http://imgur.com/gallery/9reTF), and gave them a black outline.

Finally, I added the labels, title, and the Portuguese crest, completing the map.
